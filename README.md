/ Creating a workspace for me to develop more codeing knowledge.  With the increase in subscription cost of Evernote, I'm interested in miograting to OneNote.
/ This migration tool is excellent and I doubt I can add must to it, but it will be fun to work on in my 'spare time'
/ Focus areas:
/    Learn the current program
/    Investigate ways to improve the handling of imbedded .PDF files coming out of Evernote.
/        Is there a way to run the "Print to OneNote" function from within Evernote2OneNote?
/        The printed output would then replace the imbedded .PDF file
/    Interested in the tag parsing approach that is being worked in the previous fork too
